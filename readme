This go version currently:
- doesn't work on plan9,
- can't do authentication,
- works on windows and on unix where go works,
- works on android (in termux), though not very useful at the moment,
- works both with or without plan9port,
- uses go net.Dial() address format (host:port),
- when using without plan9port, it won't clean up socket file after terminating,
- needs NAMESPACE set on windows,
- it'll default stay in the foreground.
